## Team Project - Fictional Restaurant Website Weekend Project

This HTML, CSS, and JS was created during the weekend of July 7th through July 10th, 2016.  

The goal of this project was to use a mockup and assorted JSON information, both provided and available via APIs, to recreate a one page website for a fictional restaurant.

The primary purposes of this exercise were to:

1. Gain experience working as a small team on a project from beginning to finish.  This included gathering and understanding client requirements, preliminary design collaboration, workflow management, code integration, and deployment.

2. Gain experience collaborating on a Github project, including managing and resolving merge conflicts.

3. Technical skills included HTML and CSS layout to ensure styling according to client requirements and use of Javascript functionality and AJAX calls to pull and manipulate dynamic data.  JSON data provided via basic JSON objects and from 3rd party APIs (Google & Flickr).  Integration of 3rd party scripts (Disqus) for review functionality.

4. Improve skills in responsive design. (Many elements of this project display degrees of responsive design.  However those limits are pushed once the display is reduced to mobile/phone dimensions.)
